## Versioning

Versioning system throughout follow this convention 

n.n.n

where n is an integer incremented by 1 for each version/build on the following pattern: major.minor.build

For example if the release number is

1.7.12

then 1 is the major release number, 7 is the minor release number, and 12 is the build number. 

The release version number consists only of the first two numbers (in our example 1.7)
